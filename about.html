			<h1>About {{ trademark }}</h1>
			<p>
				{{ trademark }} is a simple application, which uses extracts from over 50K literature works to correct one's broken grammar, punctuation or spelling in a given language.

				<br><br>

				The standard methods for fixing issues with grammar, punctuation or spelling have traditionally been to either study and remember all language rules, or to read a lot of books.
				While both of these methods do help, they have their own drawbacks. 

				<br>

				While reading will improve writing, it takes a lot of time, mostly because it's a passive learning method, when talking about improving your grammar. On the other hand, one may decide
				to learn all rules of the language, but some languages have so many exceptions that they may get confused. Additionally, even if one learns all the rules, practice is still needed to
				remember when and how to use them.

				<br>

				This is where {{ trademark }}, comes in. Using extracts from different types of literature works, we teach you the usage of a word in different contexts. This is done by prompting you to fill
				in the word or its corressponding variations in an extract from a text. This design makes it fast

				Currently, we only support the following languages:
				<ol>
					<li>Bulgarian - with data from <a href="https://chitanka.info">chitanka.info</a></li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h2>The story of the app's development</h2>
			<p>
				On the 31st of September 2023, <a href="https://i-use-gentoo-btw.com">Stanislav Vasilev(Madman10K)</a> decided to create a website, where he could teach himself proper bulgarian grammar,
				punctuation and spelling more effectively. He made the initial version by combining it with text data from the <a href="https://chitanka.info">chitanka.info</a> website, making it fully
				functional for writing bulgarian.
			</p>
			<p>
				The name is an acronym for "Bulgarian 考试(kǎoshì)". The latter part of the name simply means "test" in Mandarin, which we decided to use, since variations of the name in other languages were
				already taken.
			</p>
